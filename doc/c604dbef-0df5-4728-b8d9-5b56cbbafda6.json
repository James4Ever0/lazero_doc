It mentions X11 and Wayland protocols, suggesting it's designed to work on Unix-like systems. The author discusses using UUID or global object manager for coordination between scripts and handles compatibility issues for KDE on different platforms. Some features are still under consideration and the script interacts with a clipboard manager.",

It establishes a connection, writes data after a delay, and handles process exit status and received output/error data. The main function spawns a new process using reactor.spawnProcess, passing in the command to be executed ('screen -x' or 'sudo ./dockerXFS.sh'). The code also includes threading support for running the reactor.",

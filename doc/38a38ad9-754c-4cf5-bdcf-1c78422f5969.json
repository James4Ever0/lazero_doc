The function used for filtering is called \"scanner\" which takes two parameters: a string (the content of \"trench.log\") and another list containing English words. It returns a list of non-English words found in the input string. The code also uses functions \"returnXList\" and \"storeXList\" from the getFromDill and storeADill modules respectively, but their functionalities are not mentioned.",

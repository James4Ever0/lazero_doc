Alternetive source code examination tool/system is needed such as sourcegraph or sonarqube.\n## Wireshark & Frida integration\nNeed a custom router to monitor network activities, including internal transmission. A powerful hooker like Xposed/IDA/Hydra is needed, to study programs on the fly.\n## SSH/MOSH & RDP/VNC/SPICE are now on schedule, along with the QUARTZ scheduler\nWhile needing multiple shells and cursors to save exploration time, we also need a scheduler to make full use of computational resources. Kinda like TC (Thin Client) anyway."

However, a free AI can be unpredictable, never generate the same output and not be able to be manipulated.\nFree AIs do not need to be open source, but it might provide some convenience to themselves.\nBasically, a free AI has these following freedoms:\n**0.

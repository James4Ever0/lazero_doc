It asserts that the input parameters are within valid ranges. getRange calculates a grid of points based on the power of 2 of its argument a. getShift generates a list of shifted positions from a given position (a, b) in any of four directions (0: none, 1: right, 2: down, 3: diagonally down-right). It requires an integer s representing the direction and a copy of the original position.",

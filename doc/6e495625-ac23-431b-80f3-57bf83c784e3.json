It has three endpoints (\"/terminate\", \"/uuid\", and \"/refresh_uuid\"), with the main handler class handling all other routes. The \"make_app\" function sets up the web application with these handlers, and the main section of code runs a subprocess for \"ports_chooser.py\". If no data is present, it returns \"no data here.\" It writes incoming bytes to the response, and can be configured to clear data or pass a function to the link.

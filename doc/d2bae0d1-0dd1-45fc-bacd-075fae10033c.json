    "summary": "This script searches for all point of interest in a file, using convolution and rounds. It calculates the number of characters in the file and then performs rounds of iterations to extract substrings based on the length of each iteration. It uses head, tail, grep commands to find samples in the file and outputs the results. The author expresses frustration with the code's grammar and wishes it could be written in Python.",

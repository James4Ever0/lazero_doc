    "summary": "This code reads a list of process IDs (PIDs) from stdin, then filters and manages the PIDs based on certain conditions. It ensures that there are no more than a specified limit of running processes. If the limit is exceeded, it kills excessive processes or launches new ones as needed. The script also handles errors if an incorrect limit argument is provided. It utilizes the os and signal modules to interact with the operating system and terminate or launch processes.",

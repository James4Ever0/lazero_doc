The `streamDouble` function performs parallel streaming for a given sample, updates the result, and returns it. The `upDouble` function takes the result of the streaming and updates the table with the provided data. If the main script is run, it sets up the file, prints the workload length, sets batch size, and then iterates over the file, streams data, doubles it, and updates the table. It might be used to process large amounts of data by splitting it into smaller chunks for processing. The code seems incomplete as some functions are referred without proper definition, such as `regcheck`, `windowEndmarkEx`, `knock`, `get_2`, `get_3`, `show`, and `table_name`.

It uses Dredd as the backend of sandbox for compatibility reasons, although other options like proot may be helpful. Cgroup v2 might be enabled, but docker only supports v1 (systemd is causing issues). The control is maintained by an init file, and system encryption can be improved with tools like LastPass. Sandboxie and Firejail are useful for GUI tasks, while understanding the relation between pid and GUI handles is critical to safety. Interpreters and source files need optimization as they are currently wasteful.",

Their implementation is wasteful.\nIn order to "

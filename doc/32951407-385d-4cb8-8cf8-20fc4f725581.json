One thread repeatedly executes 'ls' command through the subprocess' stdin, while printing \"FROM STDIN.\" every second. The other thread tries to read from the subprocess' stdout, printing \"_STDOUT_\" each second. It uses threading for parallel execution and subprocess module to interact with the subprocess. However, the code is not efficient, as it lacks proper handling of input/output and has potential race conditions.",

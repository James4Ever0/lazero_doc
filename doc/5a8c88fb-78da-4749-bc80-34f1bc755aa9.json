    "summary": "This script checks if a port is available for usage. It first determines whether the system is Unix-like and then opens a log file named \"ports.log\". The contents of this file are read, split into a list (a), and converted to integers. A list of all ports from 8000 to 65536 is generated if the system is Unix-like or from 1 to 65536 otherwise. Ports in the \"a\" list are filtered out, and if no available port remains, it prints \"no port available.\" If an available port exists, it selects a random one and prints it. The script does not use port 0 due to unspecified reasons.",

After another sleep, it considers killing the process but decides not to do so. It prints \"__EOL__\" and attempts to exit the program. The code then considers using p.terminate() to terminate the process, discussing the need for a separate process or thread and communication methods. Finally, it concludes that somehow the code is working fine despite the challenges.",

    "summary": "The code defines functions for manipulating lists and converting them to tensors. The 'chrTens' function takes a list of characters, maps their ASCII values into numbers, and stores the modified list as a torch tensor using deep copy and indexing operations. The 'recv' and 'sayless' functions convert the tensor back to its original character representation by finding the first or last occurrence of non-zero elements in the tensor.",

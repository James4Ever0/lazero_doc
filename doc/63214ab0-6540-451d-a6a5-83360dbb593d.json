    "summary": "This C code defines a function to escape certain characters from user input and outputs the escaped text. It takes in a string of up to 500 characters, checks each character for inclusion in the TERM_WORD_CHARS list (escaped characters), and replaces them with a backslash (\\) before printing the string. The code demonstrates a straightforward approach to escape special characters, possibly for use in text editing or command-line interfaces.",

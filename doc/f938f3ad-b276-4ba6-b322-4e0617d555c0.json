The author collects data for future implementation and considers the growing image size, anticipating it to be unpleasant. They express the importance of placing the code elsewhere after their random tapping implementation. The code focuses on automation, self-aware machines, and utilizing massive collected data for optimal performance. The author also reminds readers that a real phone may struggle while a virtualbox won't.",

            "comment": "This code seems to be a mix of frustration and confusion, possibly related to a command-line interface or debugging process. The author mentions needing to type \"exit\" twice for command line removal but is unsure if it helps get adb shell. They also discuss checking USB connections, network debugging options, and reading various materials. The overall tone suggests the user is struggling with understanding the process and desires a more straightforward approach without having to read excessive information.",

I have to read them all? are you kidding me?\nno! this is my place and i do not need to read shit!"

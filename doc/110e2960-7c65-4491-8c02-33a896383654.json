            "comment": "The code seems to be part of an experiment related to mouse movements on Windows. It tracks and calculates the difference between consecutive mouse positions, potentially for further processing or analysis. The `LIMIT_INTERVAL` variable is likely used to limit the recording interval, and there are mentions of other functions like `calc`, `der`, and `initial`. However, the code appears incomplete as it ends abruptly without a clear purpose or outcome.",

    "summary": "This code defines a function `ml` that flattens lists, and a `main` function which takes a keyword, retrieves related data using the `getLinked` function, and writes the results to a file. The code uses the `time`, `pythonbasics`, and `dbM` modules for various functionalities. It allows for searching multiple pages of results, but only supports one page at a time. Results are printed, but could potentially be used for other purposes as well.",

The Terminal class reads and prints using InputStreamReader and BufferedReader, while the WrittenConsole class continuously reads and writes, handling exceptions with stack traces. The code executes commands using Runtime.getRuntime().exec() in separate threads but faces issues in Terminal class execution.",

However, the code seems to have issues with writing into the stream and handling exceptions effectively.",

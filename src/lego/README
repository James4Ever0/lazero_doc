this will be the main construction plot. all fucking gameplay is simply over.

cf is a toy project. i swear. it does not help one percent on my comprehension.

but, hey, at least we've come to the lego plot. here we go.

there should be some restrictions here.

suppose there are some offline things, such as unable to communicate to the kernel, unable to execute some code. just saying. custom kernel might help.

safety always comes after viability. if you cannot compute, then do not talk about security. there's no such thing.

so does the portability. there's no such thing when you cannot understand the cryptic GUI and documentation. it is all fucked up.

why you speak German when you can explore the entire Germany with only English?

you should do this carefully. do not let it confuse you.

first, do not make root tools get into the root.

second, is it good to use proot with symlink across ramdisk?

Device or resource busy

/dev/block/sda17 on /data type ext4 (rw,seclabel,nosuid,nodev,noatime,noauto_da_alloc,resgid=1065,errors=panic,data=ordered)

/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/userdata on /data type ext4 (rw,seclabel,nosuid,nodev,noatime,noauto_da_alloc,resgid=1065,errors=panic,data=ordered)

it is nearly impossible to run firejail inside, but libjudger can have a try.

no, it cannot be run inside the chroot. cause the pipe cannot be duplicated.

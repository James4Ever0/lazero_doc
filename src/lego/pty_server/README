there seems to be some limitation over the spot. maximum pty allocation limit in kernel compliation time.

https://linux.die.net/man/7/pty#:~:text=The%20Linux%20kernel%20imposes%20a%20limit%20on%20the,to%202048%2C%20with%20a%20default%20setting%20of%20256.`

i suggest you use cut-down version of pty to do trivial task, which not including the reading, or just about flushing every time.

if not listen, the shit might not start and balls will fall off.

or you can just try, do it in another non-terminal way. such as subprocess.Popen, which just will create script kiddies.

or better not. let's just search.

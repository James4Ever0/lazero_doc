The Node\nclass is a mixin for Accessible and the various Accessible interfaces.\nThe Action class represents an action that the accessibility layer exports as\nperformable on a specific node, such as clicking on it. It's a wrapper around\nAccessibility.Action.\nWe often want to look for a node, based on some criteria, and this is provided\nby the Predicate class.\nDogtail implements a high-level searching system, for finding a node (or\nnodes) satisfying whatever criteria you are interested in. It does this with\na 'backoff and retry' algorithm. This fixes most timing problems e.g. when a\ndialog is in the process of opening but hasn't yet done so.",
